Well, I'm into software development for [more than 20 years](http://www.infoq.com/articles/how-did-you-start-coding), now. And while there are a lot of things that changed in that time, there are also some "constants" in our business. Constants in the field of software development? In a field that seems to be changing faster and faster? Yes, at least one: The passion for creating software.   
   
Working software.   
Useful software.   
Usable software.   
   
In this blog, I would like to share random thoughts about software development. About architecture, technologie and methods. Thoughts about the way I work and thoughts about the way I would like to work.   
   
Enjoy!
